# MediaTek PCM (SPM CPU core) emulator

This code is a work-in-progress, based on a reverse-engineered ISA and an
incomplete understanding of the hardware. Don't depend on this code for anything
important.

A [Ghidra][ghidra] processor module for this instruction set can be found
[here][ghidra-module]. Until/unless someone writes some documentation for this
ISA, this is the closest thing to an ISA spec there is.
